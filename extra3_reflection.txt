1. Which conditional structure felt hardest to use?
The hardest for me was the nested if structure, because I had to carefully keep track of which conditions belonged inside others. Sometimes it was tricky to line them up correctly without mixing the logic.

2. Did trace tables help you predict results before running the code?
Yes, trace tables helped a lot. They made it easier to follow each condition step by step and see which branch the program would take, especially when more than one condition was involved.

3. What new thing did you discover in this lab?
I discovered how I can combine conditions using boolean operators (and/or) to shorten code, instead of writing many nested ifs. I also learned that small changes in order of conditions can change the programâ€™s outcome.
