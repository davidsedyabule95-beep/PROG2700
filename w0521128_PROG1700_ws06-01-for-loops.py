#  Reflection answers 

# 1. What pattern or challenge was most fun, and why?
#     I liked the diamond tree pattern! It felt creative and looked cool in the console.

# 2. How does a for loop differ from a while loop?
#     A for loop runs a set number of times, while a while loop repeats until a condition changes.
#
# 3. What real-world problems could you solve using for loops?
#     Things like calculating totals, generating patterns, or looping through lists of data (like grades).

# 4. How did you ensure your loops didn‚Äôt run infinitely?
#     I used range() and controlled counters carefully so that every loop has an endpoint.
